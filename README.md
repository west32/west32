Hi! My name is Bartłomiej and for a long time I've wanted to start programming. During quarantine due to Covid-19 I had finally an opportunity to focus on it. I used to be a muaythai and crossfit athlete, then naturally I became a coach of these sports. I like sports very much and I like to help others to grow, but I also always had a lot of love for computers. During the lockdown caused by the pandemic I started to learn to code in python and I loved it. I try to develop my programming skills every day to find my first job as a python developer
